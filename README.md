## Project Overview  
This repository offers hands-on code, notebooks and examples to understand, build and experiment with vector databases: storing embeddings, performing similarity search, hybrid search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) etc.

## Features & Scope  
- Demonstrations of key vector-database operations: indexing embeddings, nearest neighbour search, hybrid keyword + vector search.
- Baseline comparisons: keyword search vs vector search, results retrieval quality, speed/latency tradeoffs.
