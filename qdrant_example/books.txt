The ten works form a panorama of early twentieth‑century American literary modernism and social critique, orbiting the milieu that frames The Great Gatsby: rapid economic expansion, leisure-class performance, and the psychic costs of aspiration.
Fitzgerald’s trio (This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night) charts escalating disillusion. Early collegiate self-fashioning (Amory Blaine) gives way to decadent stasis (Anthony and Gloria Patch) and finally international psychological fragmentation (the Divers). Each book refines the motif of glamour as veneer over moral and emotional erosion.
Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises relocates similar postwar aimlessness to expatriate Europe. Its stripped style presents desire, jealousy, and impotence as cyclical patterns, converting Jazz Age excess into existential drift. Where Fitzgerald gilds surfaces, Hemingway subtracts, but both expose hollow centers.
Manhattan Transfer by Dos Passos widens the lens to an urban collage. Fragmented viewpoints, transit imagery, and commercial signage render the city as impersonal mechanism. Individual striving dissolves into systemic flux—an external corollary to Gatsby’s interior chasing of the green light ideal.
An American Tragedy (Dreiser) anatomizes ambition in a naturalistic register: socioeconomic determinism pushing Clyde Griffiths toward catastrophe. The pursuit of status becomes procedural, slow, and grim—ambition as structurally lethal rather than romantically doomed.
Wharton’s The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth dissect the elite social code pre‑Jazz Age, showing continuity: rigid reputation economies already constrict authentic feeling. Lily Bart’s commodified beauty and Newland Archer’s constrained longing anticipate Gatsby’s own transactional romantic idealism.
Main Street (Sinclair Lewis) shifts focus to provincial America. Carol Kennicott’s reformist energy collides with complacent small‑town norms, revealing that conformity and status anxiety are not confined to mansions and metropolitan parties; the national culture of mediocrity contextualizes Gatsby’s heightened stage.
Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury internalizes decline through fractured temporality and stream of consciousness. The disintegration of the Compson family echoes the collapse of aristocratic pretensions; memory itself becomes an unreliable asset, like Gatsby’s curated past.
Common threads: aspiration vs. structure; performance vs. authenticity; fragmentation of identity under modern pressures; the commodification of emotion and status; temporal instability (nostalgia, trauma, decay). Divergences lie in technique—lyric romanticism (Fitzgerald), minimalist reportage (Hemingway),
montage (Dos Passos), naturalism (Dreiser), social realism (Wharton, Lewis), and experimental stream (Faulkner). Together they map the cultural ecosystem that makes Gatsby’s pursuit legible: a spectrum of formal strategies diagnosing the same modern condition—ambition encountering resistant social, psychological, and historical forces, yielding irony, collapse, or quiet resignation.
